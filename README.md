# p5 Built-in Variables

## Variables Mini-Challenges

1. Use `width` and `height` to divide the a canvas into 4 different color squares. The arguments you provide to draw each rectangle should only use a combination of `width`, `height`, and `0`.  Half the width would be `width/2` or `width * 0.5`

2. Make a web using several `line`s.  The center of the web should move as you move your mouse.  There should be lines going from the center to all 4 corners as well as the midpoints of each side of the canvas.

3. Use `mouseX`, `mouseY` and the `ellipse` function to make a program that can draw a line as you move your mouse. Write your name in cursive. If you have to dot an 'i' or cross a 't' (or an 'x')... good luck!
